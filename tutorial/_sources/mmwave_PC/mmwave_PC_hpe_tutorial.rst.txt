Dataset with MetaFi: 
------------------------

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 21-24

Point cloud Pose reconstruction dataset collected by Ti 6843 mmWave radar. 40 subjects are included and the human poses are obtained by 2 RGB camera.
We provide cross-subject experiment settings with all daily activities. 
In the library, we provide a dataloader to use mmWave PC data, and predict these human poses.

mmFi utilizes PointTransformer model as a baseline hpe method. From model.hpe, we can import 
desired hpe model designed for mmWave PC. The model parameter for PointTransformer reimplemented 
for mmFi is as follows:
